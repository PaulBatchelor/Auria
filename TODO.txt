## What we have

A wrapper for Mincer and Sporth that is controllable by the f310 controller on
Linux. Sporth code plays until the user hits 'A' and freezes the audio.
Previous audio can be scrubbed in at any speed via the mincer opcode. The
audio is represented as a waveform. 


## What we want

When it starts, no sound is heard. The user must hold down 'A' and 'draw'
the sound with the left joystick. XY information is sent over channels to a
Sporth patch, where obvious timbral changes happen. Certain sporth events
will cause certain shapes to be drawn on the line, indicating markers. When 
'A' is released, mincer is kicked on, and the line can be scrubbed through 
using up/down. Hitting 'A" again erases the buffer, and the process starts
over. 

## TODO

1. Replace waveform data with 2d points. Randomly draw the line. 

2. 'A' + js controls line position. letting go turns on mincer. 

2a. scrolling buffer works
2b. Make sure scrubbing only works within the range of your line

3. scrubbing follows lines, up+down control

4a. 'A' resets the line

5. Sporth p-channels control visual elements

6. Implement collision engine + random drops

7. Collision switches Sporth patch. 

8. Crossfade
